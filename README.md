## Python / ML
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Recommendation API](https://github.com/04mscott/Recommendation-API) | Python, FastAPI, Scikit-learn, Celery, Redis, Vector Embeddings, MySQL, Docker | Built a high-performance API to pull Spotify listening data, generate vector embeddings, and make cosine similarity-based song recommendations. Data is stored in a MySQL database and served to a full-stack music app. |
| [Air Quality Prediction App](https://github.com/04mscott/Air-Quality-App/blob/main/README.md) | Python, TensorFlow LSTM, Time Series, Data Cleaning, API Integration, AWS RDS, Streamlit | Trained an LSTM model on air pollution data to forecast 8 pollutant concentrations using real-time OpenWeatherMap API inputs. Built a user-friendly dashboard in Streamlit and deployed on Render. |
| [Face Mask Image Classifier](https://github.com/04mscott/Face-Mask-Image-Classification) | Python, TensorFlow CNN, Image Classification, TaiPy | Built a CNN to classify proper face mask usage. Integrated a TaiPy GUI for real-time predictions and confidence display from uploaded images. |

## Data Science
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Reddit AITA Data Analysis (Class Project)](https://masonscott.net/static/media/HW%203%20Report%20-%20Mason%20Scott.bc9e7591820ff485558a.pdf) | Python, Pandas, Statistical Testing, Visualization | Used chi-square tests and data wrangling to study moral judgment across political affiliations using AITA-style questions from a survey dataset. Visualized results using Matplotlib. |
| [Housing Price Predictor](https://github.com/04mscott/Housing-Price-Prediction-Model-) | Pandas, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression | Built and tuned linear regression models on Kaggle housing data to predict sale prices. Performed feature engineering and model evaluation.

## React
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Personal Website](https://masonscott.net/) | JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS | Designed and built a personal portfolio website with smooth animations, responsive layout, and project integration.

## Full Stack
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **In Progress**: [Song Recommendation App](https://github.com/04mscott/Song-Recommendation-App) | React, Spring Boot, REST API, OAuth2 | Full-stack app that helps users discover music through a swipe-based UI. Recommends songs based on Spotify listening history using backend vector embeddings. Swiping right automatically adds a song to the userâ€™s Spotify liked tracks.

## C
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Sorting Algorithm Benchmarks](https://github.com/04mscott/Sorting-Functions-C-) | C, Python, Time Complexity, Data Viz | Implemented 8 sorting algorithms in C and benchmarked their performance across various input sizes. Used `ctypes` to interface with Python and visualized performance with Matplotlib.
