## ML
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Air Quality Prediction App](https://github.com/04mscott/Air-Quality-App/blob/main/README.md) | Python, Tensorflow LSTM, Time Series Modeling, API Integration, AWS RDS, MySQL, Strealit | Implemented an LSTM model to predict 8 pollutant concentration based on data from OpenWeatherMap API. Training set from same API and stored in AWS MySQL Database. Streamlit GUI with interactve graph and user input. Deployed on Render [here](https://air-quality-app-wr4z.onrender.com/). |
