## ML
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Air Quality Prediction App](https://github.com/04mscott/Air-Quality-App/blob/main/README.md) | Python, Tensorflow LSTM, Time Series Modeling, Data Cleaning/Processing, API Integration, AWS RDS, MySQL, Strealit | Implemented an LSTM model to predict 8 pollutant concentration based on data from OpenWeatherMap API. Training set from same API and stored in AWS MySQL Database. Streamlit GUI with interactve graph and user input. Deployed on Render [here](https://air-quality-app-wr4z.onrender.com/). |
| [Face Mask Image Classifier](https://github.com/04mscott/Face-Mask-Image-Classification) | Python, Tensorflow CNN, Image Classification, TaiPy | Implemented an image classification model designed to detect if a person is wearing a mask correctly, takes user input through TaiPy GUI, displays prediction along with confidence. |

## Data Science
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Data Analysis Report - Class Project](https://masonscott.net/static/media/HW%203%20Report%20-%20Mason%20Scott.bc9e7591820ff485558a.pdf) | Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning/Processing, Data Visualization, Statistical Testing | Using an anonymous survey response dataset from 3 classes, analyzed data to draw conlusions on human morality and decision making from answers to Reddit AITA style questions. Includes statistical tests and MatPlotLib visualizations for comparing groups within the dataset |
| [Housing Cost Linear Regression Model](https://github.com/04mscott/Housing-Price-Prediction-Model-) | Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Linear Regression | Implemented multiple linear regression models to predict house prices using a kaggle dataset |
