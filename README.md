## Python
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Air Quality Prediction App](https://github.com/04mscott/Air-Quality-App/blob/main/README.md) | Python, Tensorflow LSTM, Time Series Modeling, Data Cleaning/Processing, API Integration, AWS RDS, MySQL, Strealit | Implemented an LSTM model to predict 8 pollutant concentration based on data from OpenWeatherMap API. Training set from same API and stored in AWS MySQL Database. Streamlit GUI with interactve graph and user input. Deployed on Render [here](https://air-quality-app-wr4z.onrender.com/). |
| [Face Mask Image Classifier](https://github.com/04mscott/Face-Mask-Image-Classification) | Python, Tensorflow CNN, Image Classification, TaiPy | Implemented an image classification model designed to detect if a person is wearing a mask correctly, takes user input through TaiPy GUI, displays prediction along with confidence. |
| ** ***In Progress*** ** [Recommendation API](https://github.com/04mscott/Recommendation-API) | Python, Flask, Sklearn, Vector embeddings, MySQL, AWS, Relational databases | Implemented an API that pulls a users song data from Spotify and stores it in a database, as well as vector embeddings, which are used to make recommendations using cosine similarity. The MySQL database is then used to cross reference top songs, saved songs, etc. for each user |

## Data Science
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Data Analysis Report - Class Project](https://masonscott.net/static/media/HW%203%20Report%20-%20Mason%20Scott.bc9e7591820ff485558a.pdf) | Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning/Processing, Data Visualization, Statistical Testing | Using an anonymous survey response dataset from 3 classes, analyzed data to draw conlusions on human morality and decision making from answers to Reddit AITA style questions. Includes statistical tests and MatPlotLib visualizations for comparing groups within the dataset |
| [Housing Cost Linear Regression Model](https://github.com/04mscott/Housing-Price-Prediction-Model-) | Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Linear Regression | Implemented multiple linear regression models to predict house prices using a kaggle dataset |

## React
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Personal Website](https://masonscott.net/) | JavaScript, React js, HTML, CSS, Front End Development | Developed a personal website to showcase my skills and projects, using smooth animations, a clean ui, and appealing format |

## Full Stack
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ** ***In Progress*** ** [Song Recommendation App](https://github.com/04mscott/Song-Recommendation-App) | React js, Spring Boot, Restful API, OAuth2.0 | Implement a full stack application to help users find songs based on their Spotify listening history and using the [Recommendation API](https://github.com/04mscott/Recommendation-API) |

## C
| Project | Skills | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [C Sorting Algorithms](https://github.com/04mscott/Sorting-Functions-C-) | C, Python, Sorting, Time Complexity | Implemented 8 popular sorting algorithms in C and ran benchmark tests on a number of randomized lists of varying length. These benchmarks were then viisualized using the ctypes library to interface with the c program and MatPlotLib to graph the benchmarks |
